# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, enhanced with the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making. The Minimax algorithm is a recursive approach used in game theory to determine the best move for a player, assuming that both players are playing optimally.

## Features

- A functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with a user-friendly interface.
- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm to make the game challenging.
- Code organized for clarity and easy understanding.
